100% operational methods: 
r, q, K, k and b moves generators 
move
inCheck2

Most of the code works, but a few specific cases cause issues in these methods:
pawn moves gen (en passant)
allMovesGen (pinned, inCheck1 helper methods) I am going to make a lot of changes to the pinned method. 
Player interface is good for now because its designed for me to run tests at the moment. 
Eventually I want to change it so that for when someone else is running my program,
its index selection instead of piece, then it shows you available moves for that piece then new index selection.

Still need to debug: 
AI advantage eval methods (should be very easy), some of the parameters will be adjusted after 
genTopMoves
Search 
AI Move 

Currently, an opening move tree with around 100 nodes for both white and black is the only new 
thing that I am looking to implement outside of optimizing and debugging the current code. I am going 
to use 

Use effect
side effects to react hook 
side effects as a result of state changing
